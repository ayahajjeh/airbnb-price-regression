# Airbnb Price Estimation Using Regression
`This was one of my projects for CS74 Machine Learning class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, @bilanaden1 and I used data collected from Airbnb listings in New York City from 2008 to 2019 to build a regression model which estimates the price of an Airbnb listing given several relevant factors, including

  - Location (neighborhood, latitude, longitude)
  
  - Housing Information (type of room)
  
  - Booking/Housing Information (type of room, minimum # of nights, # of days in the year the listing is available, license)
  
  - Reviews (total # of reviews, date of last review, average # of reviews per month)
  
  - Host Information (host name, host id, how many listings the host has)

Please look at the project write up, the pdf file uploaded in this repository, for a deep dive into this project description, processing, analysis, and results.
