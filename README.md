# Airbnb Price Estimation Using Regression
In this project, I used data collected from Airbnb listings in New York City from 2008 to 2019 to build a regression model which estimates the price of an Airbnb listing given several relevant factors, including

  ● Location (neighborhood, latitude, longitude)
  
  ● Housing Information (type of room)
  
  ● Booking/Housing Information (type of room, minimum # of nights, # of days in the year the listing is available, license)
  
  ● Reviews (total # of reviews, date of last review, average # of reviews per month)
  
  ● Host Information (host name, host id, how many listings the host has)
